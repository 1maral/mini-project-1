Mini-Project 1: Classical encryption

Description:

Resources:
StackExchange: I used it to learn how to unzip the cipher.zip file. The command unzip "file.zip -d destination_folder" was particularly helpful.
Geeksforgeeks: I used it to learn how to work with command line arguments, how to compare two strings and how to change all letters to lowercase in java. The command args[0] is used to access the first string in the command line. And 
input1.equals(input2) when equal and (!input1.equals(input2)) when not equal. Lastly, input.toLowerCase() returns a string value, representing the new string converted to ALL lower case, but ignores numbers, etc.
